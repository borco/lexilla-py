## Status

Real `CreateLexer`/`ILexer5` bindings exist: `create_lexer`, `get_lexer_count`,
`get_lexer_name`, and a `Lexer` class (name/identifier, property get/set,
`word_list_set`, and the raw pointer for `SCI_SETILEXER`). `Lex`/`Fold` and
the cross-binding/wheel-publishing work are not done yet. Nothing is
published to PyPI yet. See
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/borco/lexilla-py/issues) for what's next.

## Why this exists

Lexilla creates the lexer objects (`ILexer5`) that a Scintilla editor widget
attaches via `SCI_SETILEXER` — it's a separate, Qt-free C++ library from
Scintilla itself since Scintilla 5.0. This project exposes that library
directly to Python, so any Scintilla binding can create and configure lexers,
not just one tied to a specific Qt/GTK/wx binding — see
[docs/specs/mission.md](docs/specs/mission.md) for the full background.

## Goals

`lexilla` aims to be:

- **MIT licensed** — usable in open-source or closed-source projects freely
- A **faithful, low-level binding** of Lexilla's `CreateLexer`/`ILexer5` C++
  API — not a redesign of it
- **Binding-agnostic** — no dependency on any particular Scintilla binding;
  the lexer pointer it creates works with any of them via `SCI_SETILEXER`
- Available as **pre-built wheels** for Linux (x86_64, aarch64), Windows
  (x86_64), and macOS (arm64, x86_64)
- **Not affiliated** with the Scintilla/Lexilla project

## Installation

Not yet published. Once it is:

```bash
pip install lexilla
```

For convenience glue with [pyside6-scintilla](https://github.com/borco/pyside6-scintilla):

```bash
pip install lexilla[pyside6-scintilla]
```

## Versioning

Version numbers follow `<Lexilla version>.<binding revision>` — e.g. `5.5.0.0`
is binding revision `0` for Lexilla `5.5.0`. The binding revision increments
for releases of this package that don't correspond to a new Lexilla version,
and resets to `0` when Lexilla itself releases a new version.
